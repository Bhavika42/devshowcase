# devshowcase
“An interactive full stack developer portfolio built with MERN.”


💡 Project Idea: “DevShowcase” – Your Interactive Developer Portfolio
Instead of a static portfolio, let’s build an interactive full stack app where you can:

Add/edit/remove your projects (stored in a database)

Display them in a clean, responsive UI

Include live demos, GitHub links, screenshots

Filter by tech stack (React, Node, etc.)

Optionally allow users to leave comments or "like" projects

🌐 Tech Stack
✅ No Tailwind. We'll use clean, hand-written CSS.

Frontend: React + CSS Modules

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Dev: GitHub Codespaces

Deploy: Netlify (frontend) + Render (backend)
